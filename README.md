A bunch of simple CLI games written in Python. All require Python 3 and nothing else.

####FlapPy (Windows only)
Flappy the Python has been trapped in an underground cave - help him fly to freedom. A Flappy Bird clone.

How to play: Hit any key (arrow keys seem to work best for some reason) to flap. Avoid hitting obstacles and drowning.

####A-Wing (Windows only)
Fly through the meteor shower.

How to play: Use A and D keys to strafe left and right. Avoid hitting meteors (@) while collecting shield power-ups (+) for when you can't.

####TicTacToe
A game of Tic-Tac-Toe. 1 or 2 player (Hotseat). Pretty challenging AI.

How to play: Enter coordinates to place your marker.
